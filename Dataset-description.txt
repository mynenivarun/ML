Parkinson's dataset:

- Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects movement. It occurs when there is a loss of dopamine-producing neurons in the brain. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in    coordinating smooth and controlled movements. Also, It can affect voice and speech in several ways, leading to changes that impact communication.

- This dataset is composed of a range of biomedical voice measurements from 42 people with early-stage Parkinson's disease recruited to a six-month trial of a telemonitoring device for remote symptom progression monitoring.

Feature Information:

1. subject# - Integer uniquely identifying each subject.
2. age - Subject's age.
3. sex - Subject's gender, where '0' represents male and '1' represents female.
4. test_time - Time since recruitment into the trial, with the integer part indicating the number of days since recruitment.
5. motor_UPDRS - Clinician's motor UPDRS score, linearly interpolated.
6. total_UPDRS - Clinician's total UPDRS score, linearly interpolated.
7. Biomedical voice measures:
    o Jitter(%), Jitter(Abs), Jitter:RAP, Jitter:PPQ5, Jitter:DDP - Measures of variation in fundamental frequency. These measures tell us about the regularity or irregularity in the pitch (tone) of the voice.

    o Shimmer, Shimmer(dB), Shimmer:APQ3, Shimmer:APQ5, Shimmer:APQ11, Shimmer:DDA - Measures of variation in amplitude. These measures indicate how smooth or shaky the amplitude (loudness) of the voice is.

    o NHR, HNR - Two measures of the ratio of noise to tonal components in the voice. These measures help us understand the balance between clear voice and background noise.

    o RPDE - A nonlinear dynamical complexity measure. This measure gives insights into the complexity of voice patterns.

    o DFA - Signal fractal scaling exponent. This feature describes how the voice signal scales, providing information about its structure.

    o PPE - A nonlinear measure of fundamental frequency variation. This measure reflects non-linear variations in pitch, contributing to our understanding of voice changes.


In summary, these features help analyze different aspects of the voice, such as pitch, amplitude, noise, complexity, structure, and non-linear variations.
